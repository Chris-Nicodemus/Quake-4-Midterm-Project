The Hunt Mod is a spin on the Capture the Flag gamemode. Both teams are now fighting against each other while
also trying to kill the boss that spawns in the middle of the map, which will give them the bounty (flag) that thy will then try to bring back to their base. If the bounty holder scores, or the enemy team kills the bounty holder and reclaims the bounty, the boss will respawn in the middle of the map. The map now has traps in various locations where a player might like to be to hamper their attempts to win. Weapons are all changed to behave like the guns from Hunt: Showdown, the inspiration of the mod. This makes all weapons feel cumbersome but lethal. What is different from Hunt: Showdown is that the loadouts are tied to classes, and each class comes with their own ability. 

You can select a class at any time while you are alive by pressing the numbers 1-5. The classes are as follows:

Classless:
(The default loadout uses a bolt action rifle and has no ability.)

1: Sorcerer
Weapons: Lightning staff(buffed lightning gun) and a bolt action rifle.
The lightning gun's damage is drastically increased, but the ammo drains 10x faster.
The bolt action rifle (machine gun) is made to resemble the Marksman Lebel rifle from Hunt.
Ability: Charge Staff
The sorcerer's ability is to charge the staff every few seconds. (Map lightning ammo has been changed to a trap so this is the only way to get ammo)
This is the only ability that is directly tied to a specific weapon.

2: Wraith
Weapon: Shotgun
The shotgun was refit to only carry 1 shot, but that one shot is highly lethal with a very tight spread.
Ability: Wraith Walk
The wraith has the powerful ability to walk through walls as they like, however, they cannot interact with objects, nor can they shoot while in this state.

3: Assassin
Weapon: Crossbow
The crossbow is a modified nailgun that has been made to only have one shot, but boasts much more accuracy. The speed of the nailgun was also vastly increased and the damage has been raised to be capable of killing a player with a direct hit.
Ability: Teleport
The assassin has th ability to teleport instantly, but suffers a very long cooldown for such an advantage.

4: Vampire
Weapon: Nitro Express Rifle
The Nitro Express Rifle is a famous weapon in Hunt for it's insanely high damage and effective range. The rate of fire for such a weapon is surprisingly high, but it's drawbacks are its ammo availability and long reload times. The bullets that this gun fires are absolutely massive and thus you can only carry 6 rounds, including the 2 inside your rifle already. To mimmick this in Quake, I increased the damage of the railgun to 175, decreased its rate of fire, and put a delay between firing a shot and reloading to simulate a longer reload animation.
Ability: Blood Thirst
The vampire gains lifesteal for a time, healing 25 health for each well placed shot.

5: Barbarian
Weapon: Repeater Rifle
There is only one gun in the entirety of Hunt: Showdown that fires more than one bullet at a time, and that is the Mosin Nagant Avtomat. It fires 3 very lethal bullets in quick succession, but eats through its ammo incredibly quickly. Even with a mag size of 15, the player can only carry 12 shots in reserve, which is not even enough to complete reload you weapon. Other than the obvious change of giving hyperblaster burst fire, it also now enjoys higher damage and heavily increased travel speed.
Ability: Undying Rage
It's quite simple, while the ability is active, the Barbarian can't die! Living on with at least 1 health no matter what is thrown at them.


Traps:

1. Shock Trap
(Looks like lightning ammo)
Effect: Renders the player unable to move for a short time

2. Poison Trap
(Looks like grenade ammo)
Effect: Every 5 seconds, for 30 seconds, the player takes damage

3. Binder
(Looks like mega health)
Effect: While bound, the player cannot make use of their class abilities, which can prove highly lethal

4. Cursed Rock
(Looks like rocket ammo)
Effect: Grants the victim maximum health and armor (this is the only way you can get armor in this game mode), but they will die in 20 seconds, no matter what.

5. Demon Pact Circle
(Modified Quad Damage)
Effect: The Quad Damage Pickup now costs the user a huge amount of their health and it will just outright kill the player if they do not have enough. The player also cannot heal from the cursed rock if thy also step on that trap, but the curse will still kill them in 20 seconds.
